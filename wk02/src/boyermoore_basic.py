"""
Boyer Moore Basic is a simpler implementation of the full Boyer Moore version.

The only thing is that it ONLY uses the bad character rule. It's simpler and
easier to grasp without good suffix rule and galil's optimisation.

- k is the position in the pattern where a mismatch occurs.

- R(x) is the rightmost occurrence of a character x in the pattern P.
    The thing about this here; unlike the real BM algo, it doesn't change.

- On each mismatch do max(k - R(x), 1) to find out how much to the alignment
  shift by.
